# logbackRceDemo
The project is a simple vulnerability Demo environment written by SpringBoot. Here, I deliberately wrote a vulnerability environment where there are arbitrary file uploads, and then use the `scan` attribute in the loghack configuration file to cooperate with the logback vulnerability to implement RCE.
